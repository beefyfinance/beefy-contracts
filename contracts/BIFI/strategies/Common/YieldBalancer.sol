/**
 * @title Yield Balancer
 * @author sirbeefalot
 * @dev This strategy serves as a load balancer for multiple vaults that optimize the same asset. 
 * 
 * It doesn't implement its own farming strategy and doesn't implement a 'harvest()' function. It insteads 
 * distributes the funds deposited into its parent vault into a group of subvaults called 'workers'. 
 * Each worker implements its own farming strategy and harvest frequency. 
 * 
 * The balancer can manage up to {workersMax} workers, due to gas concerns. It can allocate from 0% to 100% of the available 
 * funds into each of these workers.
 * 
 * The implementation looks to make it as cheap as possible for users to use the vault. The worker at index '0' works as 
 * the 'main' worker. It's where user deposits go and where user withdrawals come out first.
 * The balancer then has a few toggles like {rebalancePair} or the global {rebalance} to make sure it achieves and maintains 
 * the desired fund distribution between all the workers. The strategy owner can use {switchWorkerOrder} to optimize worker 
 * order within the {workers} array.
 *
 * This architecture works on the pragmatic assumption that there's usually a farm on a given platform or within a given asset 
 * that can withstand the most TVL. There are secondary farms that can be used to relieve pressure from the main one 
 * and to increase overall APY. The calcs to determine optimal allocation ratios happen offchain. This contract provides the tools
 * for trustless fund management and rebalance.
 *
 * It doesn't need exclusive usage of a worker. This is meant so that balancers can be deployed to take advantage of previously
 * deployed vaults, or vaults that some users might want to use directly.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Subvaults that serve as workers can't charge withdrawal fees to the balancer.
