/**
 * @dev Implementation of a strategy to get yields from farming LP Pools in PancakeSwap.
 * PancakeSwap is an automated market maker (“AMM”) that allows two tokens to be exchanged on the Binance Smart Chain.
 * It is fast, cheap, and allows anyone to participate. PancakeSwap is aiming to be the #1 liquidity provider on BSC.
 *
 * This strategy simply deposits whatever funds it receives from the vault into the selected StakingRewards pool.
 * HELMET and CAKE rewards from providing liquidity are farmed every few minutes, sold and split 50/50. 
 * The corresponding pair of assets are bought and more liquidity is added to the StakingRewards pool.
 * 
 * This strat is currently compatible with all LP pools.
