/**
 * @dev Implementation of a strategy to get yields from farming LP Pools in PancakeSwap.
 * PancakeSwap is an automated market maker (“AMM”) that allows two tokens to be exchanged on the Binance Smart Chain.
 * It is fast, cheap, and allows anyone to participate. PancakeSwap is aiming to be the #1 liquidity provider on BSC.
 *
 * This strategy simply deposits whatever funds it receives from the vault into the selected MasterChef pool.
 * CAKE rewards from providing liquidity are farmed every few minutes, sold and split 50/50. 
 * The corresponding pair of assets are bought and more liquidity is added to the MasterChef pool.
 * 
 * This strat is an adaptation that only works with the CAKE community pools. This assets have pool liquidity through BNB
 * so we route directly through CAKE.
