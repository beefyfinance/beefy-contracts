 * @author kexley
 * @notice Implementation for an ERC-4626 wrapper of a Beefy Vault
 * @dev Wrapped Beefy Vault tokens can be minted by deposit of the underlying asset or by 
 * wrapping Beefy Vault tokens in a 1:1 ratio. Wrapped Beefy Vault tokens can either be unwrapped
 * for an equal number of Beefy Vault tokens or redeemed for the underlying asset.
 * ERC4626 rules are strictly enforced, preview functions should return the correct values.
 * Only vaults which do not update their asset balance on deposit can be wrapped, i.e. vaults which
 * have profit locked or not harvesting on deposit, and the underlying balance is not updated on interactions.
