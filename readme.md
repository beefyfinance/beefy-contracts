# Beefy Contracts
Official repo for all the strategies and vaults from Beefy. Community strategists can contribute here to grow the ecosystem.

## Vault Deployment Process
### 1. Select a farm
The first step to have a vault deployed on Beefy is to select a farm to deploy a vault around. At the moment the rewards for a strategist are:
 - 0.5% of all rewards earned by a vault they deployed. 
 - BNB paid out by the [Binance BUIDL program ](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901064/Introducing-the-BUIDL-Reward-Program-for-Binance-Smart-Chain)

This means that you want to select a farm with: 
1. High APR 
2. High expected TVL 
3. Long farm life 

Another thing to take into account is how many farms the platform has. We try to reuse code as much as possible. New code can create vulnerabilities, should be tested, etc. So platforms like Pancakeswap, where there's 50 pools which  can rehuse 99%-100% of the code are best. Not only you will be able to reuse the contracts code. Also the API and App.

A good way to get started is to deploy a new vault for a platform where Beefy already has a few live vaults. This way you will have to change very few things.

### 2. Prepare the smart contracts. 
If you decided to do a simple LP vault, or a single asset vault, the most likely thing is that there is a working template that you can use. Most farms work under a version of Sushiswap's [MasterChef.sol](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/master/contracts/MasterChef.sol) contract. The ones that don't, tend to use the Synthetix RewardPool.sol (like [we did](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-protocol/blob/master/contracts/RewardPool.sol)). This means that for the most part you can just copy/past something like the StrategyCakeLP.sol strategy, change a few addresses and variable names, update the comments and you're good to go. 
You should always review the third party code looking for potential exploits or backdoors. A simple way is to diff their MasterChef against a trusted version of the same contract and review the changes.

### 3. Test the contracts
If you're doing something completely custom you should add automated tests to facilitate review and diminish risks. If it's a copy/paste from another strategy you can get by with manual testing for now as everything has been battle tested tested quite a bit. 

### 3. Deploy the smart contracts
Once you are confident that everything works as expected you can do the official deploy of the vault + strategy contracts. There are [some scripts](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-contracts/blob/master/scripts/) to help make deploying easier. 
Once you're sure the production contracts work as expected you should call 
`transferOwnership()`on both the strategy and vault contract and give the ownership to the official Beefy account at `0xd529b1894491a0a26B18939274ae8ede93E81dbA` 
This is required so that we can review everything before the vault is actually live on the app and manage it after its live.

### 4.  Update App 
The only file you really need to touch on the app is [pools.js](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-app/blob/master/src/features/configure/pools.js). This is the config file with all the live pools.  Just copy one of the other pools as template, paste it at the top (Below the BIFI Maxi) and fill it out with your data. `earnedTokenAddress`and `earnedContractAddress`should both be the address of the vault contract.

### 5. Update the API 
If you're deploying a vault for a platform where we already have live vaults, you will probably only need to add some data to the respective config file in the [data](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-api/tree/master/src/data) folder. For example if you're doing a new Pancakeswap LP vault, you only need to add the relevant data at [cakeLpPools.json](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-api/blob/master/src/data/cakeLpPools.json)

If it's a new platform you're going to have to add code to a few files, but it's still easy.
 
1. Create a data file for the platform in the [data](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-api/tree/master/src/data) folder and fill out the farm data. 
2. Create a folder under /api/stats and add code to get the APYs. You will probably be able to just copy/paste one of the others like [getCakeLpApys.js](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-api/blob/master/src/api/stats/pancake/getCakeLpApys.js) 
3. Import and run the new file from [getApys.js](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-api/blob/master/src/api/stats/getApys.js)
4. Copy/paste a handler for that data [here](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-api/blob/master/src/api/price/index.js).
5. Lastly, add a route handler to the [router.js](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-api/blob/master/src/router.js) so that people and the app can access lp prices.

### 6. Update the Cowllector 
The final step. In the [beefy-cowllector](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-cowllector) repo, add the strategy contract [here](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-cowllector/blob/master/data/strats.json) so that it will be harvested. And the vault contract [here](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-cowllector/blob/master/data/defistation.json) so that Defistation will display it.

### Done! 
Another Beefy dev will review everything, merge the PRs and ship it to production.
